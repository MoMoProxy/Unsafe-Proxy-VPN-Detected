<h1>What Does "Unsafe Proxy or VPN Detected" Mean?</h1>
<p>As online gaming and streaming rise in popularity, many users rely on proxies and VPNs for privacy and access to restricted content. However, messages like “unsafe proxy or VPN detected” can disrupt the experience. This article explores the causes of this warning and offers solutions, including technical setups and code examples.</p>
<p>The warning signifies that a website has flagged the connection as untrustworthy, often due to the proxy or VPN lacking adequate security.</p>
<h2>Why Does This Warning Appear?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Quality of Proxy Servers</strong>: Free or low-quality proxies may lack security features, leading to flagging.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared IP Addresses</strong>: Suspicious activity from one user can blacklist a shared IP, affecting all users.</li>
    <li><strong>Geolocation Issues</strong>: Proxies routing traffic through high-risk countries can trigger detection.</li>
    <li><strong>Encryption Levels</strong>: Weak encryption exposes user data, prompting warnings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detection Mechanisms</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>IP Blacklisting</strong>: Websites maintain databases of known proxy IPs, blocking flagged addresses.</li>
    <li><strong>DNS Leak Detection</strong>: Direct DNS requests can expose the user's real IP.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed Monitoring</strong>: Unusual request speeds can indicate proxy use.</li>
    <li><strong>HTTP Header Analysis</strong>: Headers may reveal original IPs if not modified by the proxy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Bypass Unsafe Proxy Detection</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Reliable Proxy Services</strong>: Opt for trusted providers like <a href="https://momoproxy.com">MoMoProxy</a> that offer rotating residential IPs and strong encryption.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine VPNs with Proxies</strong>: Enhance security by using both. Here’s a basic Python example:
        <pre>
import requests

proxies = {
    'http': 'http://your_proxy_ip:proxy_port',
    'https': 'https://your_proxy_ip:proxy_port'
}

response = requests.get('https://www.now.gg', proxies=proxies)
print(response.text)
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Update Proxy Settings</strong>: Ensure correct proxy configurations in your browser settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear Cache and Cookies</strong>: Refresh your connection by clearing cached data.</li>
    <li><strong>Try Different Proxy Locations</strong>: Switch to less congested proxies if flagged.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Browsing Behavior</strong>: Avoid rapid requests to reduce the risk of detection.</li>
    <li><strong>Disable WebRTC</strong>: Disable WebRTC in your browser to prevent IP leaks.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Customer Support</strong>: Reach out to your proxy provider for tailored assistance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding the reasons behind the “unsafe proxy detected” message, such as poor proxy quality or inadequate security, enables users to take proactive steps.
